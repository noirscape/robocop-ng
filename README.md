# Detrius

A fork of robocop-ng for the rationalwiki support chat with some features removed that aren't needed.

Robocop readme is provided below.

## robocop-ng

Next-gen rewrite of Kurisu/Robocop bot used on ReSwitched bot with discord.py rewrite, designed to be relatively clean, consistent and un-bloated.

Code is based on https://gitlab.com/a/dpybotbase and https://github.com/916253/Kurisu-Reswitched.

## How to run

- Copy `config.py.template` to `config.py`, configure all necessary parts to your server.
- Enable the `Server Members` privileged intent ([guide here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html?highlight=intents#privileged-intents)) for the bot. You don't need to give Discord your passport as Robocop-NG is not designed to run at >1 guild at once, let alone >100.
- (obviously) Add the bot to your guild. Many resources about this online.
- If you haven't already done this already, **move the bot's role above the roles it'll need to manage, or else it won't function properly**, this is especially important for verification as it doesn't work otherwise.
- Install python3.6+.
- Install python dependencies (`pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt`, you might need to put `sudo -H` before that)
- If you're moving from Kurisu or Robocop: Follow `Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop` below.
- Run `Robocop.py` (`python3 Robocop.py`)

To keep the bot running, you might want to use pm2 or a systemd service.

## Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop

If you're moving from Kurisu/Robocop, and want to preserve your data, you'll want to do the following steps:

- Copy your `data` folder over.
- Rename your `data/warnsv2.json` file to `data/userlog.json`.
- Edit `data/restrictions.json` and replace role names (`"Muted"` etc) with role IDs (`526500080879140874` etc). Make sure to have it as int, not as str (don't wrap role id with `"` or `'`).
